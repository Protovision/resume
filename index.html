			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Tutor<br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					January 2019 - March 2019</p>
					<p>Helped walk-in students understand and complete computer science assignments, especially those that require a lot of coding. Typical assignments I helped students with involved the implementation of common data structures, pattern matching using finite state machines, and the implementation of rudimentary virtual machines.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Teaching Assistant<br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					April 2016 - December 2018</p>
					<p>With Dr. Turner's permission, I designed and prepared course material for beginning computer science students as well as give several 1-2 hours lectures; this went on for several quarters, each quarter lasting 10 weeks. Class sizes per quarter were 50 on average. Material mostly covered introductory computer programming using C++. I created and maintained several course websites during my work here.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Undergraduate researcher<br>
					University of California, Santa Barbara<br>
					August 2015 - September 2015<br></p>
					<p>Summer research program where I and 4 other computer science students from our school were selected to perform research on image processing at UCSB. The research was part of a 7 year grant from the National Science Foundation that awarded over $3.1 million (NSF-IIS, Award Number: 0808772). During my research with Utkarsh Gaur as my mentor, I used the Torch framework to develop and run artificial neural networks for classifying images. I also developed an application for automating the loading, testing, and saving of deep ANN classifiers and their data sets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Software engineer and project manager<br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					April 2015 - June 2015</p>
					<p>I managed a team of 4 other students where our project, initiated by Dr. Concepcion, was to track the occupancy of a library through IoT devices. My contributions included the sole design and assembly of an internet-enabled, arduino device that used infrared sensors for detecting horizontal motion in two directions. I also set up the web server and database for the device to send it's statistics to, the rest of my team developed an Android app for retrieving and displaying the statistics from the server.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Programmer<br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					August 2014 - September 2014</p>
					<p>Sole programmer for the development of a visual novel game in collaboration with 2 art students. I developed a visual novel game engine that used SDL to display 2D graphics and simple animations with the story of the visual novel driven by Lua scripts. The game engine was cross-platform and capable of executing visual novels packaged as self-contained zip files.</p>
