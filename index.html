			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><b>Tutor</b><br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					January 2019 - March 2019</p>
					<p>Helped walk-in students understand and complete computer science assignments, especially those that require a lot of coding. Typical assignments I helped students with involved the implementation of common data structures, pattern matching using finite state machines, and the implementation of rudimentary virtual machines.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Teaching Assistant</b><br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					April 2016 - December 2018</p>
					<p>With Dr. Turner's permission, I designed and prepared course material for beginning computer science students as well as give several 1-2 hours lectures; this went on for several quarters, each quarter lasting 10 weeks. Class sizes per quarter were 50 on average. Material mostly covered introductory computer programming using C++. I created and maintained several course websites during my work here.</p>

					<p><b>Undergraduate researcher</b><br>
					University of California, Santa Barbara<br>
					August 2015 - September 2015<br></p>
					<p>Summer research program where I and 4 other computer science students from our school were selected to perform research on image processing at UCSB. The research was part of a 7 year grant from the National Science Foundation that awarded over $3.1 million (NSF-IIS, Award Number: 0808772). During my research with Utkarsh Gaur as my mentor, I used the Torch framework to develop and run artificial neural networks for classifying images. I also developed an application for automating the loading, testing, and saving of deep ANN classifiers and their data sets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Software engineer and project manager</b><br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					April 2015 - June 2015</p>
					<p>I managed a team of 4 other students where our project, initiated by Dr. Concepcion, was to track the occupancy of a library through IoT devices. My contributions included the sole design and assembly of an internet-enabled, arduino device that used infrared sensors for detecting horizontal motion in two directions. I also set up the web server and database for the device to send it's statistics to, the rest of my team developed an Android app for retrieving and displaying the statistics from the server.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Programmer</b><br>
					California State University, San Bernardino<br>
					August 2014 - September 2014</p>
					<p>Sole programmer for the development of a visual novel game in collaboration with 2 art students. I developed a visual novel game engine that used SDL to display 2D graphics and simple animations with the story of the visual novel driven by Lua scripts. The game engine was cross-platform and capable of executing visual novels packaged as self-contained zip files.</p>

					<p><b>Quake is Dead</b><br>
					<a href="https://protovision.github.io/quake_is_dead/">https://protovision.github.io/quake_is_dead/</a><br>
					My personal blog</p>
					<p>My blog which I wrote from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a single page application and static website hosted by Github Pages. It is responsive to screen size using CSS media queries and page transitions are fast where only the main content area is updated after the standard Javascript Fetch API is used to fetch blog entries. Fade in and fade out effects offer smooth page transitions. For slower connections, a loading spinner is shown if any content takes longer than 1 second load. I am constantly improving the site and hope to make it into a full blown progressive web app with offline functionality in the future.</p>

					<p><b>Resume</b><br>
					<a href="https://protovision.github.io/resume/">https://protovision.github.io/resume/</a><br>
					An online version of this resume</p>
					<p>Another static website hosted by Github Pages in the form of this resume. No Javascript is used here but it uses clean and semantic HTML. CSS gives it the appearance of a real paper resume while making it responsive to smaller screen sizes and it's printer friendly.</p>

					<p><b>TTK Calculator</b><br>
					<a href="https://protovision.github.io/ttk-calc/">https://protovision.github.io/ttk-calc/</a><br>
					TTK (Time to Kill) calculator for video games</p>
					<p>Many kinds of video games, especially first person shooters, enable characters to use weapons that have various stats. This application enables one to calculate the Time to Kill, which is how fast a target will die, based on weapon stats such as damage, firing rate, projectile speed, and target vitality.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>socketstream</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/socketstream">https://github.com/Protovision/socketstream</a><br>
					<code>std::iostream</code> derived C++ library for cross-platform, TCP socket I/O</p>
					<p>A header-only C++ library I made for creating synchronous TCP connections for both server and client communication; it's especially well suited for small projects such as IRC bots. The library is in the form of 2 classes that are based off I/O classes that are standard to C++, making them interoperable with standard C++ library features. It is cross-platform and compatible with C++03 but also takes advantage of move-semantics from C++11.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>bitstuff</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/bitstuff">https://github.com/Protovision/bitstuff</a><br>
					C++ routines for type casting based on reinterpreting the underlying bits</p>
					<p>C++ has a relatively new standard function <code>std::bit_cast</code> which performs a conversion by reinterpreting object representation that would otherwise be illegal. It only works for types of equal object size, I have made variations of this function that works for sizes of differing types along with each operation being <code>constexpr</code>, enabling them to be subject to compile-time optimizations.</p>

					<p><b>mht</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/mht">https://github.com/Protovision/mht</a><br>
					A simple hashtable implementation in C.</p>
					<p>Out of both an interest and a need, I developed a hashtable implementation for C. It's supported operations include: inserting an element as a key/value pair, lookup of an element from it's key, deleting an element, deleting all elements, reallocating the hashtable's capacity and performing a rehash of all elements, and the ability to traverse all elements of the unordered hashtable. The implementation uses the open addressing hash collision resolution technique. Non-empty buckets are linked so that traversal is always strictly linear with respect to the number of elements. Pointers to table entries remain valid after table modification (unless a reallocation occurs) and the hashtable automatically grows in proportion to a load factor.</p>

					<p><b>moonbase</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/moonbase">https://github.com/Protovision/moonbase</a><br>
					A 2D graphical platform for executing embedded Lua scripts</p>
					<p>moonbase is able to execute zip files that contain Lua scripts, image files, and sound files. The Lua scripts contain the logic code that drives what the moonbase engine does whose capabilities include drawing 2D graphics, rendering text, rendering images, rendering sound, and restricted file system access. The application uses Lua coroutines to continually run the rendering loop, with callbacks into Lua on events such as mouse or keyboard input, or to pause the rendering loop to give time for the Lua script to continue it's execution of the main logic. The engine was written in C and uses SDL 2.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>webserver</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/webserver">https://github.com/Protovision/webserver</a><br>
					A very simple web server in C</p>
					<p>For fun and self-education, I decided to implement a basic web server. This web server was made in C and uses the POSIX Socket API and POSIX pthreads so it only works on Linux (I have not tested it on Mac OS). When executed with a specified directory and listening port, it serves files from that directory from GET requests.</p>

					<p><b>DeepLearning</b><br>
					<a href="https://github.com/Protovision/DeepLearning">https://github.com/Protovision/DeepLearning</a><br>
					Code I produced during my research internship at UCSB</p>
					<p>During my 8 week research internship at UCSB (listed above), I studied object recognition using artificial neural networks. My experiments, under the mentorship of Utkarsh Gaur, had me use Lua with the Torch framework to build and run these neural networks that took advantage of both CPU and GPU power. My code enabled us to automate the performance of multiple experiments that had varying neural network models and training parameters such as: learning rate, learning rate decay, weight decay, and learning momentum. The program for performing these experiments could save and load separately saved neural network models, their training state, and various training parameters and run them.</p>

					<p><b>Course websites</b><br>
					Course websites I created as a teaching assistant at CSUSB</p>
					<p>These course websites that I created contains content all written by me to help Dr. Turner teach lower division computer science courses at CSUSB. Under his permission, I also gave lectures on the topics I wrote about.</p>
